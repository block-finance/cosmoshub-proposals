# Proposal for enabling issuance of fungible tokens on the Cosmos Hub

_*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***_

This proposal has been submitted on YYYY/MM/DD as proposal X on chain-id "cosmoshub-1".

## Executive summary
This proposal is a first step towards issuance of fungible tokens directly on the Cosmos Hub.

To ensure that the Cosmos Hub remains a pillar of trust, issuance of new tokens will be granted on an individual basis through the addition of a new proposal type to the existing governance system.

## Background
In its current state, the primary utility of the Cosmos Hub is to demonstrate a working BPoS model and governance mechanisms.

The utility of the hub is expected to improve when IBC, one of the biggest value propositions of the Cosmos network, is implemented and enabled.

The work on IBC is on-going at [https://github.com/cosmos/ics](https://github.com/cosmos/ics) and is on track to eventually become a standard for interchain communication.

Regardless of the current IBC roadmap, fairly modest changes to cosmos-sdk will open up new possibilities for Cosmos Hub attracting value and real transaction volume to the network.

## Purpose
This governance proposal is _intended to gauge the interest_ of allowing issuance of fungible tokens directly in the Cosmos Hub, alongside its native ATOM token.

The advantages of implementing this proposal include:
* Lowers the "barrier to entry‚Äù for organizations and entities wishing to leverage the existing security and community that has been established on Cosmos Hub. Not all projects may want or need to maintain their own zone.

* Provides an immediate use for Cosmos Hub prior to the introduction of IBC.

* Attracts more value and transaction volume to the Cosmos Hub, thus increasing the value of ATOM.

The proposal restricts listing of new tokens to those that can pass the governance process. This acts as a quality filter for projects and strengthen the trust in the Cosmos Hub.

## Details
We propose that the governance proposal transactions are expanded with a new [`ProposalKind`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/f635b1cd14daf3c40ac7ae611643a3c1c4bec5e6/x/gov/proposals.go#L119), e.g. `ProposalTypeAddToken`. This would allow new tokens to be introduced through standard governance without the need for network upgrades.

In addition to this, a natural way to extend the SDK would be as a `x/issuance` module. Tokens issued by this module will be first class citizens and transferable via IBC.

Proposals must include an issuer address (preferably multisig) from where new tokens can be minted and destroyed, along with _a set of tokens_ that will be enabled on acceptance.

The reasons for allowing more than one token in a proposal include:
1) Projects may require multiple tokens to be listed at the same time and need "transactional acceptance", e.g. Maker requiring both DAI and MKR.
2) Reduction of governance overhead, as projects can opt to list batches of tokens with similar properties, e.g. [e-money.com](https://e-money.com) listing several fiat backed tokens.

## Motivation
[e-money.com](https://e-money.com) has an immediate ambition to issue fungible tokens backed by fiat currencies in the Cosmos Network. The longer term goal is to launch a separate zone, but pending the arrival of IBC we expect that significant value can be created for the network by issuing directly on the Cosmos Hub.

Other projects will be able to use these tokens. Obvious use cases include services accepting fiat payments, exchanges and wallet providers.

Validators and delegators will also benefit from the additional transaction volume on the network, which will lead to an increase in collected fees.

Full disclosure: [e-money.com](https://e-money.com) is part of the same group of companies as [validator.network](https://validator.network), the author of this proposal.

## Not in scope
Besides issuance, the token life cycle is specifically not in scope. The potential removal of an issued token from the Cosmos Hub is left for a future governance proposal, if deemed necessary.

It is left to the discretion of each validator to decide if added tokens will be accepted as fee tokens.

## Voting options
| Vote             | Interpretation |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Yes              | I want the community to move forward with the idea of issuing custom tokens directly on the Cosmos Hub. |
| No               | I support issuance of custom tokens on the Cosmos Hub, but with a different implementation. |
| NoWithVeto       | Custom tokens should only originate in other zones and be present in the Cosmos hub through IBC. |

## Next steps
Following a successful (Yes) vote, the next steps are:
* Determine funding source: Tendermint, Interchain Foundation, community fund, crowdfunding, etc. 
* Determine implementation team: Tendermint or 3rd. party
